## 📡 Introduction

Welcome to the source code of my personal **Cybersecurity Portfolio & Knowledge Base**. 

This project is designed to be more than just a static resume; it serves as a **living digital workspace** where I document my journey in **Blue Team Operations**, **SOC Analysis**, and **Threat Hunting**. The platform is built to simulate a command-line interface (CLI) and operational dashboard environment, reflecting the tools I use daily (Splunk, Linux Terminals, SIEM dashboards).

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture & Features

This website was engineered with a focus on **performance**, **security**, and **technical aesthetics**. It moves away from standard templates to offer a unique user experience tailored for cybersecurity professionals.

### 🖥️ UI/UX Design (Cyber-Themed)
* **CLI-Style Landing:** Features a JavaScript-based **Typewriter Effect** simulating a terminal boot sequence upon entry.
* **Dark Mode Native:** Designed with high-contrast neon accents (`#58a6ff`, `#3fb950`) to reduce eye strain during long reading sessions, mimicking IDEs and terminal environments.
* **Classified Personnel Card:** A custom CSS-styled "About Me" section featuring a scanning animation and dynamic status indicators.
* **System Status Indicator:** A pulsing "OPERATIONAL" signal in the footer, adding to the SOC dashboard atmosphere.

### 🛠️ Functionality & Tools
* **Technical Admonitions:** Custom SCSS classes implemented to render **Warning**, **Info**, and **Tip** boxes. These are crucial for highlighting **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** and safety warnings in malware analysis reports.
* **RSS Feed Integration:** Fully configured `feed.xml` for cybersecurity professionals who use aggregators like Feedly to track new write-ups.
* **Smart Navigation:** Includes a dynamic "Back to Top" utility and a clean, distraction-free navigation structure.

### 🔍 SEO & Visibility
* **Search Engine Optimization:** Configured with a custom `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` to ensure proper indexing by search engines.
* **Open Graph Tags:** Optimized meta tags for rich previews on LinkedIn and Twitter/X.
* **Favicon Engineering:** Multi-resolution favicon implementation for cross-browser and Google Search compatibility.
